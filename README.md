# Analyzing Youtube Channel Performance

We take a look at a youtube channel(Ken Jee's Youtube Channel) and analyze the performance of the channel as well as determining the success of a published video on the first 30-days based on different metrics. We create a front end application displaying the various trends associated with each video related to the the channel. We as well compare the the top countries with the most views and engagements on the channel.
